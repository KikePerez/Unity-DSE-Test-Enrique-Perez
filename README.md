# Unity DSE Test Enrique Perez
 This Repository contains multiple Unity Projects for the first part of the interview test.
Please solve the following problems. You can use the Unity Documentation, Scripting
Reference, Stack Overflow, Google, etc:

1.1. Extend the following vertex and fragment shader to use Light Probe illumination
from the scene, affecting the object being rendered.

1.2. Create a native plugin with a function written in Objective-C/Java/C/C++, which is
called from Unity in a C# script, receives a string and returns it reversed.

1.3. Create a Unity project using C# jobs to calculate the sum of the R channel, for
each texture element of a texture. To do this, split the texture into four regions of
equal size, the operation should be processed by jobs running in parallel.

1.4. Use VFX Graph to create a particle system that moves along a Bezier curve.

1.5. Create two prefabs using cubes with a shared material, packing each prefab into
a separate asset bundle. Use a script to load the prefabs and instantiate them in
the scene. Do not use Addressables
